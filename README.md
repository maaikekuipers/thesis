# EPA2942 Master Thesis Maaike Kuipers

## Introduction
This project focuses on scraping and analyzing AI-generated content labels on TikTok and YouTube Shorts. It collects video URLs based on hashtags, retrieves metadata using platform APIs, and analyzes the presence and impact of AI-content labels.

The project consists of several scripts for scraping URLs, fetching metadata, and checking AI labels directly on video pages.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the environment for running this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Install Git (required to clone repositories):
   Git Installation Guide: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

3. Install Playwright (used for automated browser scraping):
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   Playwright Documentation: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

4. Set up YouTube API Access (required for fetching video metadata):
   YouTube Data API v3 Guide: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

5. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

6. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

7. Install required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

8. Store authentication cookies for YouTube (used for label scraping):
   playwright codegen youtube.com --save-storage=youtube_cookies.json
   Click on “Reject all cookies” when prompted.
   Then close the browser window to save the cookies.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Scrape Hashtag Videos
- YouTube Shorts:
  python hashtag_search.py
- TikTok Videos:
  python hashtag_search.py
  (Ensure PLATFORM and SEARCH_HASHTAG are set correctly in the script.)

2. Final Hashtag URL Check
  python final_hashtag_check.py

3. AI-Generated Content Label Check (YouTube Shorts Only)
  python YouTube/label_check.py

This script visits YouTube Shorts and checks for AI-generated content labels using Playwright.

## Notes

- API keys and cookies are managed through variables in the scripts. Ensure valid API key are in the YouTube hashtag_search.py before running.
- Playwright may prompt for browser installation during the first run.
- Ensure that headless = False when you run the platforms specific hashtag_search.py. 
- TikTok scraping requires manual captcha solving. A 30-second pause is included to handle this.
